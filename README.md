# Economic Analysis: Obama Economy vs Trump Economy

This is a period calculation to see risk levels between the presidential shifts between President Donald J. Trump and President Barack H Obama. The leading indicators will include the Gross Domestic Product, Unemployment Rate, Inflation Rates, Stock Market Performance, Consumer Confidence Index, Wage Growth, and even Poverty Rates.


## Roadmap

- Determine the project's scope, including the specific economic indicators that need analysis. 
- Collect historical economic indicators for the selected assets over a relevant period. This data will be obtained from various sources, such as FRED.
- Calculate the periodic returns based on the price data. Returns can be calculated as the percentage change in economic indicators over a specific period
- Perform statistical analysis on the returns data to identify patterns, trends, and statistical properties.
- Calculate and visualize the economic indicators that mark essential dates that may show policies or events that caused spikes within the data points.
- Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the asset's response to changes in market factors. 
- Analyzing a portfolio of assets, consider the correlations between the assets. 
-  Interpret the analysis results and provide a comprehensive report summarizing the price risk analysis. Include key findings, risk metrics, sensitivity analysis results, and any recommendations or insights based on the analysis.
